    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound (450g) fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the fettuccine pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened.</li>
      <li>Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until smooth and creamy. Continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened.</li>
      <li>Season the Alfredo sauce with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it out by adding some of the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.</li>
      <li>Serve the Alfredo pasta hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Enjoy your creamy and indulgent homemade Alfredo pasta!</li>
