    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound (450g) pizza dough, homemade or store-bought</li>
      <li>1 cup (240ml) marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup (120g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (60g) sliced pepperoni or your favorite pizza toppings (optional)</li>
      <li>Olive oil, for brushing</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a baking sheet or pizza stone in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
      <li>Divide the pizza dough into equal portions, depending on how many calzones you want to make. Roll out each portion of dough on a lightly floured surface into a circle or oval shape, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
      <li>Spoon a few tablespoons of marinara sauce onto one half of each dough circle, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the marinara sauce, then add your desired toppings such as pepperoni or vegetables.</li>
      <li>Carefully fold the other half of the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Press the edges firmly to seal, then crimp the edges with a fork to ensure they are tightly sealed.</li>
      <li>Brush the tops of the calzones with olive oil for a golden crust.</li>
      <li>Carefully transfer the calzones to the preheated baking sheet or pizza stone. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the calzones are golden brown and crispy.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving. Serve with additional marinara sauce for dipping if desired.</li>
